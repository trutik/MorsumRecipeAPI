The code in this repo was created for the task described below.

Using python and Flask construct a REST API about recipes.
Create a few tables in a mysql database that has recipe information and recipe ingredients.
Create an API to

Good python techniques should be used, especially regarding the design of the API. Furthermore, some
error handling is also expected.
